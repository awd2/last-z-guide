            <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
            <p><strong>Gacha Go strategy:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Best for Golden Wrenches</strong> — essential for vehicle mods</li>
                <li><strong>Save 300 keys</strong> — buy 70 wrenches at best rate</li>
                <li><strong>~410 diamonds per wrench</strong> (based on player data) — vs 300 in VIP shop</li>
                <li><strong>Keys carry over</strong> — save between events</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="qa-tip"><strong>Goal:</strong> 10,000+ wrenches for max vehicle level.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What is Gacha Go?</h2>
            <p>Gacha Go is a recurring diamond-spending event that rewards Golden Wrenches, Modification Blueprints, and gift boxes. Golden Wrenches are essential for <a href="formation-power.html">vehicle modification</a> and unlocking powerful vehicles like Hercules.</p>

            <p><strong>Why Golden Wrenches matter:</strong> You need 10,000+ Golden Wrenches for max vehicle level. This event is the fastest way to collect them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How Gacha Go Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost per draw:</strong> 500 diamonds for 1 draw, or 5 draws at a time</li>
                <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Gift boxes, keys, Golden Wrenches, Modification Blueprints, speedups</li>
                <li><strong>Points system:</strong> Every draw earns points toward milestone rewards</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Limited space for gift boxes — delete unwanted items to continue</li>
                <li><strong>Keys carry over:</strong> Unused keys transfer to the next Gacha Go event</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Exchange Rates</h2>
            <p>Keys can be exchanged for Golden Wrenches at these rates. For another great diamond-spending event, see our <a href="lucky-discounter.html">Lucky Discounter guide</a>:</p>

            <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Keys Required</th>
                        <th>Golden Wrenches</th>
                        <th>Efficiency</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10 keys</td>
                        <td>2 wrenches</td>
                        <td>5 keys per wrench (worst)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>60 keys</td>
                        <td>12 wrenches</td>
                        <td>5 keys per wrench</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>300 keys</td>
                        <td>70 wrenches</td>
                        <td>4.3 keys per wrench (best)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Always save for the 300-key bundle. It gives significantly better value than smaller purchases.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Diamond Efficiency Analysis</h2>
            <p>Real spending data from 55,000 diamonds:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diamonds spent:</strong> 55,000</li>
                <li><strong>Golden Wrenches obtained:</strong> 134</li>
                <li><strong>Cost per wrench:</strong> ~410 diamonds</li>
                <li><strong>VIP shop price:</strong> 300 diamonds (10 wrenches for 3,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Value:</strong> Bulk wrenches + bonus milestone rewards</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Gacha Go is luck-based. Results vary. The main advantage is bulk accumulation (VIP shop only allows 10 wrenches/week), plus you get bonus rewards from point milestones.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Point Milestones</h2>
            <p>As you spend diamonds, you earn points toward milestone rewards:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>5,000 points:</strong> Golden Wrenches + bonus items</li>
                <li><strong>8,000 points:</strong> 15 Golden Wrenches + Modification Blueprint + Gift Voucher</li>
                <li><strong>Higher tiers:</strong> Additional Golden Wrenches and rare items</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Gift Voucher from 8,000 points can be used in future events — don't skip this milestone if you're close.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Optimal Strategy</h2>

            <h3>1. Set Your Budget</h3>
            <p>Decide how many diamonds you'll spend before starting. A good target is 30,000-55,000 diamonds to accumulate enough keys for the 300-key bundle.</p>

            <h3>2. Focus on Keys</h3>
            <p>Your primary goal is accumulating keys. Gift boxes and other items are secondary. Delete speedups and unwanted items to make storage space.</p>

            <h3>3. Save Keys for Bulk Purchase</h3>
            <p>Don't spend keys on small bundles. Wait until you have 300 keys, then buy the 70 Golden Wrench bundle for maximum efficiency.</p>

            <h3>4. Skip Animation</h3>
            <p>Use the skip animation option to speed up draws. Some players report better key drops with animation skipped (unconfirmed).</p>

            <h3>5. Carry Over If Needed</h3>
            <p>If you don't reach 300 keys, save them for the next Gacha Go event. Keys don't expire between events.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Storage Management</h2>
            <p>When storage is full, you have options:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delete items:</strong> Remove speedups and items you don't need</li>
                <li><strong>Continue drawing:</strong> You'll only receive keys (no boxes) when full</li>
                <li><strong>Open boxes:</strong> Claim rewards to free up space</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Delete items you can't afford to buy anyway. Focus on accumulating keys first.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Gacha Go vs VIP Shop</h2>

            <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Method</th>
                        <th>Cost per Wrench</th>
                        <th>Pros</th>
                        <th>Cons</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Gacha Go</td>
                        <td>~410 diamonds</td>
                        <td>Bulk farming, bonus rewards, keys carry over</td>
                        <td>Luck-based, time-limited event</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>VIP Shop</td>
                        <td>300 diamonds</td>
                        <td>Guaranteed, always available</td>
                        <td>Limited to 10/week, slow accumulation</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Use both. Buy VIP shop wrenches monthly, but use Gacha Go for bulk farming when you need to progress quickly. For other ways to boost your power, check our <a href="power-guide.html">Power Guide</a>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Rush Golden Wrenches?</h2>
            <p>Vehicle modification requires massive amounts of Golden Wrenches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Max vehicle level:</strong> 10,000+ Golden Wrenches total</li>
                <li><strong>VIP shop pace:</strong> Only 10 wrenches/week = slow accumulation</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you want to progress vehicle mods in a reasonable timeframe, Gacha Go is essential. Waiting for VIP shop alone would take too long.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>Is there a daily limit on keys from Gacha Go?</summary>
                <p>There may be soft limits on certain rewards per day, but keys can generally be accumulated continuously. The exact mechanics aren't fully documented.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Should I buy the 60-key bundle or save for 300?</summary>
                <p>Always save for 300 if possible. The efficiency difference (4.3 vs 5 keys per wrench) adds up significantly over time.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What about Modification Blueprints?</summary>
                <p>Blueprints are a bonus, not the main goal. Focus on Golden Wrenches first — you'll get enough blueprints naturally from the event.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>When does Gacha Go appear?</summary>
                <p>Gacha Go is a recurring event. Watch for it in the events tab and plan your diamond spending accordingly.</p>
