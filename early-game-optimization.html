            <h2>Early-Game Optimization (First 3–7 Days)</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Connect Shooter Stages with Base Growth</h3>
                <p>Last Z is built around two intertwined modes: shooter stages and base management. Shooter stages give resources and unlock new territory, while base upgrades strengthen your combat team and unlock new systems. Treat stage progression and base growth as one loop, not two separate grinds.</p>
                <p>For mechanics and route choices, see <a href="shooter-stages.html">Shooter Stages Guide</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Master Shooter Stage Rewards</h3>
                <p>Barrels, gates, XP crates, and indestructible hazards dictate how fast you grow. Barrels can drop extra troops, weapon upgrades, or buffs, but if the damage cost is too high, bypass them. Numbered gates grant large bonuses when reduced to zero, and XP crates are a reliable early source of hero experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Go HQ-First and Track the Prerequisite Rotation</h3>
                <p>Headquarters unlocks features and caps hero/building levels. From HQ8 onward, Laboratory is mandatory, and the second requirement follows a fixed rotation through City Walls, Alliance Center, and the three Camps (Assaulter, Shooter, Rider). Keep these buildings close to HQ level so upgrades never stall.</p>
                <p>Use the <a href="hq.html">HQ Upgrade Guide</a> to plan levels and requirements in advance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Keep the Main Laboratory Close to HQ</h3>
                <p>Laboratory upgrades are required for every HQ level starting at HQ8. A second Laboratory unlocks at HQ18 but requires a Research License to build, so it’s not part of the core early-game path.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Secure Core Resources and Hero XP</h3>
                <p>Food, wood, and electricity are essential for building upgrades and troop training, while hero XP primarily comes from shooter stages and XP crates. Keep these core resources stable so you don’t hit construction or training bottlenecks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 6: Build a Balanced Hero Core with Faction Synergy</h3>
                <p>Early teams should include a defender, DPS, and support hero. Stacking multiple heroes from the same faction activates synergy bonuses, so build around a core faction rather than spreading XP across too many unrelated heroes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 7: Focus Hero Recruitment and Campaign Unlocks</h3>
                <p>Most heroes come from the gacha system (Hero menu and the Club once unlocked). Campaign missions unlock features and systems while guiding you toward the right upgrades, so clear them as soon as they appear.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 8: Time Upgrades Around Full Preparedness</h3>
                <p>Full Preparedness runs in 4-hour cycles with different themes. The Shelter Upgrade window awards points for finishing buildings and using construction speedups, making it the best time to complete major upgrades.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 9: Use a Clear Building Priority Ladder</h3>
                <p>Keep HQ, Laboratory, Camps, Military Center, City Walls, and at least one Formation near your HQ level. Production Center, Alliance Center, Villa, Bookstore, and Rally Square are strong mid-priority upgrades, while resource buildings, Warehouse, and Trade Center are lower priority unless required by HQ or events.</p>
            </div>

        <section class="tips-section">
            <h2>Advanced Early-Game Tips & Pitfalls</h2>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li><strong>Territory unlocks matter:</strong> Each shooter stage contributes to opening new land and unlocking additional buildings—don’t ignore stage progression.</li>
                <li><strong>Pick high-value targets:</strong> Barrels and gates can yield big bonuses, but skip them if the damage cost is too high; XP crates are always worth prioritizing.</li>
                <li><strong>Use faction bonuses:</strong> 3/4/5 heroes of the same faction grant increasing ATK and faction buffs—build around one core.</li>
                <li><strong>Match factions to troops:</strong> Blood Rose → Assaulters, Wings of Dawn → Shooters, Guard of Order → Riders for best synergy.</li>
                <li><strong>Unlock 4th skills first:</strong> Getting all main heroes to 4★ unlocks their 4th skill and outperforms pushing one hero to 5★ early.</li>
                <li><strong>Lab No. 2 is paid-gated:</strong> A second Laboratory unlocks at HQ18 only with a Research License—treat it as a later upgrade.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploit the 4-hour cycles:</strong> Full Preparedness repeats one theme daily; finish builds during the Shelter Upgrade window.</li>
                <li><strong>Upgrade speed buildings:</strong> Villa boosts construction speed and Bookstore boosts research speed—solid mid-priority targets.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep resource buildings modest:</strong> Upgrade them only when required by HQ or events to avoid early resource traps.</li>
                <li><strong>Campaign unlocks are fast wins:</strong> They open new systems, heroes, and training faster than random upgrades.</li>
            </ul>
