            <h2>Daily Checklist</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Trucks — 4 Deliveries + 4 Attacks</h3>
                <p>Complete 4 truck delivery missions and attack 4 enemy trucks daily. This gives you resources and counts toward multiple events. Don't skip — it's one of the easiest ways to progress.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Bounty Missions + Plunder + Helps</h3>
                <p>Complete your bounty missions. Do 5 plunders from other servers for cross-server rewards. Help alliance members 5 times — <strong>focus on orange help requests</strong> as they give better rewards to your allies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Full Preparedness — 18 Points</h3>
                <p>Earn at least 18 points in Full Preparedness every day. This unlocks daily rewards and contributes to weekly milestones. Easy points from activities you're already doing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>4. Furylord — 4 Attacks with Buffs</h3>
                <p>Attack Furylord 4 times daily. <strong>Always activate opponent attack buff</strong> before attacking. Use supreme general appointment for bonus damage. Check the 50% bonus faction and use those heroes when possible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>5. Danger Lurks — Until Main Reward</h3>
                <p>Complete Danger Lurks stages until you get the main reward. Use <strong>Auto team-up</strong> feature to save time — it automatically matches you with other players.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>6. Mines — Occupy 4</h3>
                <p>Keep 4 mines occupied at all times. Higher level mines = better resources. Check periodically as mines can be captured by other players.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>7. Hot Events — All Free Tasks</h3>
                <p>Check Hot Events tab and complete all free tasks. Claim all available rewards. These reset regularly, so check multiple times per day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>8. Idle Reward — Every 8 Hours</h3>
                <p>Claim Idle Reward every 8 hours. It caps at 8h of accumulation — don't let it overflow. Set reminders if needed: morning, afternoon, night.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>9. Free Gifts — Hunt Red Dots</h3>
                <p>Search the entire game interface for red notification dots. These indicate free gifts, rewards, or claimable items. Check all menus — free stuff is hidden everywhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>10. Radar Events — Every 8 Hours</h3>
                <p>Complete all radar events every 8 hours. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Stack events on Sunday and Thursday. Claim them on Monday and Friday to maximize <a href="alliance-duel.html">Alliance Duel</a> points.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>11. Arena — 5 Wins</h3>
                <p>Win 5 arena battles daily. Use <strong>free refresh</strong> to find weaker opponents. Don't waste attempts on players you can't beat — easy wins count the same.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>12. Daily Tasks — 150 Points</h3>
                <p>Complete enough daily tasks to reach 150 points. This unlocks all daily task rewards. Most tasks overlap with activities above, so you'll hit 150 naturally.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>How often should I check Idle Reward?</h3>
                <p>Every 8 hours. It caps at 8 hours of accumulation, so checking more often doesn't help. But don't let it sit longer — you lose potential rewards. Morning, afternoon, and night works well.</p>

                <h3>When should I do radar events?</h3>
                <p>Every 8 hours. Pro tip: Stack events on Sunday and Thursday, then claim on Monday and Friday. This maximizes your Alliance Duel contribution on key days.</p>

                <h3>How do I maximize Furylord damage?</h3>
                <p>Always activate opponent attack buff before attacking. Use supreme general appointment. Check which faction has 50% bonus damage and prioritize those heroes. Do all 4 attacks daily.</p>
