            <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
            <p><strong>The 5 most important tips:</strong> 1) Prioritize HQ upgrades — it's the core building that unlocks everything. 2) Join a strong, active alliance — tech bonuses and gifts matter more than you think. 3) Focus on ONE faction and 5 main heroes only. 4) Do ALL daily activities without exception. 5) Don't waste resources on low-impact buildings — save for major milestones.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Tip #1: Prioritize Headquarters Upgrades</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>HQ is the Core Building</h3>
                <p>Your Headquarters limits EVERYTHING in the game:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can't upgrade ANY building above your HQ level</li>
                    <li>New troops, researches, and features unlock with HQ</li>
                    <li>Higher HQ = access to stronger alliances</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Always prioritize HQ upgrades over everything else. See our <a href="hq.html">HQ Upgrade Guide</a> for details.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Buildings to Focus On</h3>
                <p><strong>Priority buildings (required for HQ):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Laboratory</strong> — Required for EVERY HQ upgrade. Start it immediately after HQ finishes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rider Camp, Assaulter Camp, Shooter Camp</strong> — Rotate as HQ requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Alliance Center</strong> — Required at certain levels</li>
                    <li><strong>City Walls</strong> — Required at certain levels</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Secondary priority:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Hospital</strong> — Important for troop survival</li>
                    <li><strong>Military Center</strong> — Increases troop capacity</li>
                    <li><strong>Rally Square</strong> — Stop at level 20 (level 25 only adds 1 person)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Buildings to AVOID Upgrading</h3>
                <p><strong>These buildings have terrible ROI:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Farmhouse</strong> — Resource output is too low</li>
                    <li><strong>Residence</strong> — Gem production is minimal</li>
                    <li><strong>Wind Turbine</strong> — Electricity production doesn't justify cost</li>
                    <li><strong>Smelting Plant</strong> — Enhancement alloy production is slow</li>
                    <li><strong>Warehouse</strong> — Not worth prioritizing</li>
                    <li><strong>Training Ground</strong> — Skip unless specifically required</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Math:</strong> Four resource buildings at max level produce less than 2 million resources daily. The upgrade cost is 16+ million. That's 8+ days just to break even — terrible investment.</p>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Tip #2: Join a Strong Alliance</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Why Alliance Matters</h3>
                <p>A strong alliance provides:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tech bonuses</strong> — Research speed, construction speed, troop stats</li>
                    <li><strong>Alliance gifts</strong> — Members who spend give everyone rewards</li>
                    <li><strong>Alliance Duel rewards</strong> — Diamond league gives massive badges and resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Event support</strong> — Enemy Buster day, rallies, coordination</li>
                    <li><strong>Protection</strong> — NAP agreements, defense help</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>What to Look For</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High alliance tech levels</strong> — Check Skillful Craftsman (construction speed) and research speed</li>
                    <li><strong>Active members</strong> — Daily gifts, alliance help, event participation</li>
                    <li><strong>Good <a href="alliance-duel.html">Alliance Duel</a> ranking</strong> — Diamond league alliances get 6 versatile fragments + 1,500 badges for weekly victory</li>
                    <li><strong>Honest leadership</strong> — Avoid alliances that cheat or have drama</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Don't Hesitate to Switch</h3>
                <p><strong>Switch alliances if:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your current alliance isn't helping you grow</li>
                    <li>Low activity and no gifts</li>
                    <li>Poor Alliance Duel performance</li>
                    <li>Leadership makes bad decisions</li>
                    <li>They're picking fights with stronger alliances</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Real example:</strong> One player noticed their rank-1 alliance was "cheating" and making enemies with the strongest player on the server. They switched to the stronger alliance BEFORE the war happened. Their old alliance is no longer rank 1.</p>
                <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Watch alliance activities carefully. If they don't align with smart gameplay, leave before it's too late.</p>

            <h2>Tip #3: Smart Hero Development</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Choose ONE Faction</h3>
                <p>The three factions counter each other:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blood Rose</strong> → counters Guard of Order</li>
                    <li><strong>Guard of Order</strong> → counters Wings of Dawn</li>
                    <li><strong>Wings of Dawn</strong> → counters Blood Rose</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>For new players:</strong> Wings of Dawn is recommended because most players choose Blood Rose. You'll have an advantage in most battles. See our <a href="heroes.html">Hero Tier List</a> for rankings.</p>
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Switching factions later is VERY expensive. Choose wisely at the start.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Focus on Main 5 Heroes Only</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your formation uses 5 heroes — focus ALL resources on them</li>
                    <li>Your 6th hero should have minimal equipment</li>
                    <li>Don't spread orange equipment across many heroes</li>
                    <li>Get all 5 main heroes to orange equipment BEFORE buying more from Merit Shop — see <a href="gear.html">Gear Guide</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>4-Star Rule for Support Heroes</h3>
                <p><strong>Keep heroes at 4-star maximum if they have support skills:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Construction speed buffs</li>
                    <li>Training speed buffs</li>
                    <li>Exploration EXP buffs</li>
                    <li>Gathering speed buffs</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Only upgrade beyond 4-star:</strong> Heroes with pure combat skills (attack, defense, HP).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Selena (Blood Rose) — all skills are combat-focused. Upgrade to 5-star and beyond. Sophia — has construction speed skill. Keep at 4-star.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Match Troops to Your Faction</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blood Rose</strong> → Focus on Assaulter troops (Selena boosts Assaulter attack)</li>
                    <li><strong>Wings of Dawn</strong> → Focus on Shooter troops</li>
                    <li><strong>Guard of Order</strong> → Focus on Rider troops</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Upgrade T9/T10 troops for your main faction FIRST before other troop types.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Keep Research Aligned</h3>
                <p>In Elite Troops research, prioritize the troop type that matches your faction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blood Rose → Assaulter research first</li>
                    <li>Wings of Dawn → Shooter research first</li>
                    <li>Guard of Order → Rider research first</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Tip #4: Never Skip Daily Activities</h2>

            <h2>Tip #5: Efficiency Over Activity</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>DON'T Keep Builders Busy Just Because</h3>
                <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Upgrading random buildings to avoid idle builders.</p>
                <p><strong>Better approach:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Save resources for HQ upgrades</li>
                    <li>It's OK to have idle builders</li>
                    <li>One major upgrade is worth more than five small ones</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you need resources for HQ 28, don't waste them upgrading Farmhouse just to keep builders working.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Save Resources for Milestones</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>HQ upgrades (always priority)</li>
                    <li>Laboratory (required for HQ)</li>
                    <li>Alliance Center (required at certain levels)</li>
                    <li>T10 troops unlock (Lab level 30)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Research Timing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Badge-consuming research:</strong> Only on Day 3 of Alliance Duel (Age of Science)</li>
                    <li><strong>Badge-free research:</strong> Any day (New Home, Shelter Building, Elite Troops)</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority:</strong> Alliance Recognition FIRST before any other badge research</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Plan Upgrades in Bulk</h3>
                <p><strong>For maximum Alliance Duel points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upgrade hero stars in one day (1→2 star, 2→3 star)</li>
                    <li>Save wrenches for Day 1 (Modded Vehicle Boost)</li>
                    <li>Save speed-ups for the right day</li>
                    <li>Don't spread upgrades across random days</li>

            <h2>Quick Reference: 25+ Pro Tips</h2>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li><strong>HQ is king</strong> — Always prioritize HQ upgrades</li>
                <li><strong>Lab immediately</strong> — Start Laboratory right after HQ finishes</li>
                <li><strong>Skip resource buildings</strong> — Farmhouse, Residence, Wind Turbine are traps</li>
                <li><strong>Rally Square cap</strong> — Stop at level 20</li>
                <li><strong>Alliance tech matters</strong> — Look for high research/construction speed</li>
                <li><strong>Switch alliances</strong> — Don't stay loyal to a dying alliance</li>
                <li><strong>One faction only</strong> — Switching later is expensive</li>
                <li><strong>Wings of Dawn</strong> — Best for new players (counters popular Blood Rose)</li>
                <li><strong>5 heroes max</strong> — Don't spread equipment across many heroes</li>
                <li><strong>4-star rule</strong> — Keep support heroes at 4-star</li>
                <li><strong>Match troops to faction</strong> — Blood Rose = Assaulters</li>
                <li><strong>Send trucks daily</strong> — Can drop component chests</li>
                <li><strong>Use all arena attempts</strong> — Top 50 = 2 versatile fragments</li>
                <li><strong>18 points Full Prep</strong> — Minimum 3 complete events daily</li>
                <li><strong>Never skip events</strong> — Small daily rewards add up</li>
                <li><strong>Idle builders OK</strong> — Better than wasting resources</li>
                <li><strong>Badge research Day 3</strong> — Age of Science only</li>
                <li><strong>Alliance Recognition first</strong> — Before any badge research</li>
                <li><strong>Bulk upgrades</strong> — Save for Alliance Duel days</li>
                <li><strong>Merit Shop</strong> — Orange equipment weekly until main 5 have it</li>
                <li><strong>Bounty missions</strong> — Can give 5k diamonds</li>
                <li><strong>Tyrant = free power cores</strong> — 500/week</li>
                <li><strong>T9 first</strong> — Upgrade your faction's troop type first</li>
                <li><strong>Watch alliance politics</strong> — Leave before wars you can't win</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency beats intensity</strong> — Daily logins matter more than binges</li>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Spreading Resources Across All Heroes</h3>
                <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Upgrading every hero you get instead of focusing on your main 5.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong> Orange equipment and fragments are limited. A weak team of 10 heroes loses to a strong team of 5.</p>
                <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Focus ALL resources on your main 5 formation heroes. Keep others at 4-star max.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Upgrading Wrong Buildings</h3>
                <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Building resource production (farms, residences, wind turbines) instead of HQ prerequisites.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong> Resource buildings give minimal income compared to gathering. They waste builder time.</p>
                <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Prioritize HQ, Laboratory, Camps, Alliance Center. Skip resource buildings until late game.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Using Speedups Randomly</h3>
                <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Using construction/research/training speedups whenever available.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong> You miss Alliance Duel points and Full Preparedness sync bonuses.</p>
                <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Save speedups for specific Alliance Duel days — construction Tuesday, research Wednesday, training Friday.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>4. Ignoring Alliance Recognition Research</h3>
                <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Doing combat research before unlocking Alliance Recognition chests 1-9.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong> You miss double daily rewards (badges, alloys, fragments) for months.</p>
                <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Get Alliance Recognition to unlock 9 chests first. The doubled rewards compound massively over time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>5. Staying in a Bad Alliance</h3>
                <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Staying loyal to an inactive or poorly-led alliance.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong> Less alliance tech, fewer gifts, bad Alliance Duel rankings, possibly getting zeroed in wars.</p>
                <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Switch to an active alliance with good leadership. Watch for signs of trouble before it's too late.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>6. Mixing Factions</h3>
                <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Building heroes from multiple factions instead of focusing on one.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong> You lose faction bonuses (10% HP, attack buffs) and counter advantages.</p>
                <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Choose one faction (Wings of Dawn recommended for new players) and commit fully.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>7. Skipping Daily Activities</h3>
                <p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Missing trucks, arena, bounty missions, or Full Preparedness events.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it hurts:</strong> These rewards compound over months. Bounty missions alone can give 5,000 diamonds.</p>
                <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Log in at least twice daily. Complete all daily activities — consistency beats intensity.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What buildings should I prioritize?</h3>
                <p>Priority: HQ, Laboratory, Camps (Rider/Assaulter/Shooter), Alliance Center, City Walls. Secondary: Emergency Hospital, Military Center, Rally Square (stop at 20). AVOID: Resource buildings (Farmhouse, Residence, Wind Turbine, Smelting Plant).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Which faction should I choose?</h3>
                <p>Wings of Dawn for new players — it counters Blood Rose, which most players use. Pick ONE faction and commit. Switching later is very expensive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How many heroes should I focus on?</h3>
                <p>Only your main 5 formation heroes. Keep others at 4-star maximum. Save all orange equipment for your main 5. Don't upgrade heroes with support skills (construction, training speed) beyond 4-star.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I keep builders busy at all times?</h3>
                <p>NO. This is a common mistake. Save resources for major milestones like HQ upgrades. Idle builders are better than wasted resources on low-impact buildings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When should I switch alliances?</h3>
                <p>Switch if: low activity, poor tech levels, bad Alliance Duel performance, poor leadership decisions, or they're making enemies with stronger alliances. Don't stay loyal to a dying alliance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What daily activities should I never skip?</h3>
                <p>Send trucks, use all 5 arena attempts, help allies, complete daily missions, bounty missions, radar tasks. Complete 3+ Full Preparedness events (aim for 18 points). Participate in all rotating events.</p>
