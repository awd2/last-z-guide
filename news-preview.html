      <div><strong>Text:</strong> Some questions; What is the hero pool for this seasonal tickets; do they just spawn the heros mentioned or do they also give purple or blue heros tickets as well? And secondly i have heard about gold rush; can you just buy 1 hero and 1 equip of their’s? Or you can have enough points to buy two equip? As I already have Scarlett but not her equip and i wanna buy that. But also wanna buy nyx and her equip.</div>

      <div><strong>Text:</strong> I am level 30 and when I took my formation 1 out a level 28 was able to take me pretty easy, so I tried it on him too but he was harder to kill with his first formation out. I have stronger heroes and research but his tank is stronger. Any tips on how to make your base harder to kill without your first formation in?</div>
