      <div><strong>Text:</strong> How long are the devs gonna take to redo these packages. 2 weeks without the great choice deal now and no daily package specials for the specific alliance duel day. If they want to push us all to their store they could at least put better packages there but all the ones on the site are terrible compared to what we used to get. Almost no point in playing the game anymore if you’re further along as there’s no way to progress in a timely manner for free anymore.</div>

      <div><strong>Author:</strong> /u/Novel_Ordinary2357</div>
      <div><strong>Date:</strong> Feb 23, 2026, 01:15 UTC</div>
      <div><strong>Text:</strong> Server 409 started strong and competitive. Multiple alliances were active, strong players were engaged, and the server had real potential. Then things changed. Humoud became a whale account and, alongside Gladiator and Silences (real-life friends reportedly sharing the same account), began systematically dismantling top alliances. Alliances affected: POEX NOVA AFB KAAN CPAA/TNO (his former home) Many strong players quit after repeated full alliance wipes. Instead of healthy competition, the server turned into one dominant force removing all opposition. Recently, several TNO members moved to NUBL. Days later, some returned voluntarily. Shortly after, TNO was wiped again. Players were reportedly told they must remain in NUBL or not join any alliance at all. Whether you support him or not, the result is clear: Server 409 is weaker. Competition is gone. Players are quitting. If his goal is to leave the server after destroying it, future servers should take note. This is not about personal hate. It’s about what kind of environment we want in LastZ.</div>
