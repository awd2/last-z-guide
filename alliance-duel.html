        </section>

        <section class="quick-answer">
            <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
            <p><strong>Alliance Duel is about saving resources and spending on the right days.</strong> You don't need to spend money — just save wrenches, alloys, power cores, and fragments for their specific days. Sync with Full Preparedness events (system time 8 and 20) to score in both events simultaneously. Priority research: Alliance Recognition — it doubles rewards and unlocks chests 7-9.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>The Core Strategy</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Save Resources, Spend on Right Days</h3>
                <p>The entire Alliance Duel strategy comes down to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Save</strong> — Don't use items randomly throughout the week</li>
                    <li><strong>Sync</strong> — Match your spending with Full Preparedness events</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop</strong> — Don't chase 6 million if you can't afford it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Full Preparedness Sync</h3>
                <p>Full Preparedness events run at <strong>system time 8 and system time 20</strong> (Echoplus time). During these windows, you score points in BOTH events simultaneously.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> On Training day, do your troop training at system time 8 or 20 to get Alliance Duel points AND Full Preparedness rewards.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Priority Research: Alliance Recognition</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Why Alliance Recognition First</h3>
                <p><strong>This is the most important research in the game for F2P players.</strong> It doesn't give fighting power, but it:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Doubles daily rewards</strong> — 240 badges instead of 120, 40k alloys instead of 20k</li>
                    <li><strong>Unlocks chests 7-9</strong> — Access to all Alliance Duel rewards</li>
                    <li><strong>Gives more versatile fragments</strong> — 2 orange fragments instead of 1</li>
                    <li><strong>Increases score capacity</strong> — Easier to hit 6 million points</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Badge Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Event King research:</strong> ~143,500 badges total</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Expert:</strong> Additional 22-44k badges</li>
                    <li><strong>Full max:</strong> 175-200k badges total</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The investment pays off:</strong> Once maxed, you earn 8,000+ badges per week from Alliance Duel alone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Research Benefits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Event King:</strong> +200% global score modifier</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Expert:</strong> +100% points</li>
                    <li><strong>Combined:</strong> 300% extra points when maxed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Day-by-Day Strategy</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Day 1 (Monday): Modded Vehicle Boost</h3>
                <p><strong>What gives points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using golden wrenches</li>
                    <li>Using modification blueprints</li>
                    <li>Opening vehicle component boxes</li>
                    <li>Opening chip chests (orange = 1 million points!)</li>
                    <li>Radar tasks</li>
                    <li>Rally boomers</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Save radar tasks from Sunday</li>
                    <li>Open ALL component boxes and chip chests on Monday only</li>
                    <li>Buy 15 wrenches weekly (10 VIP store + 5 Glory shop)</li>
                    <li>Stop at 6 million — save remaining items for next week</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Using components doesn't give points. Only OPENING boxes gives points.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Day 2 (Tuesday): Shelter Upgrade</h3>
                <p><strong>What gives points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Construction upgrades</li>
                    <li>Construction speed-ups</li>
                    <li>Recruiting refugees (orange = 165k points)</li>
                    <li>Orange bounty missions (247k points each)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Save 20-40 refresh tickets</strong> — Use ONLY on Tuesday for orange missions</li>
                    <li><strong>Refugee trick:</strong> Recruit once, then "Try Your Luck" to save tokens</li>
                    <li>When orange refugee appears — DON'T reset, recruit them</li>
                    <li>Save unfinished buildings for future upgrades</li>
                    <li>Sync with Full Preparedness at system time 8 and 20</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> This is one of the HARDEST days. If you can't reach 6 million, stop at 3 million. Speed-ups are scarce.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Day 3 (Wednesday): Age of Science</h3>
                <p><strong>What gives points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research speed-ups</li>
                    <li>Tech points</li>
                    <li>Consuming badges</li>
                    <li>Orange intercity trade trucks (4 trucks = 1.2 million points)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use research speed-ups ONLY on Wednesday</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Use badges ONLY on Wednesday</strong></li>
                    <li>Complete 4 orange intercity trades = 1.2M points (easy)</li>
                    <li>Focus on Age of Science at system time 8 and 20</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Another hard day. Stop at 3 million if resources are low — at least get one versatile fragment.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Day 4 (Thursday): Hero Initiative</h3>
                <p><strong>What gives points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hero fragments (any color)</li>
                    <li>Exclusive equipment fragments (orange only)</li>
                    <li>Primary recruitment</li>
                    <li>Power cores (equipment upgrade)</li>
                    <li>Equipment upgrades</li>
                    <li>Orange skill books</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easiest day to score!</strong></li>
                    <li>Focus on orange gear upgrades first</li>
                    <li>Upgrade main 5 heroes equipment ONLY</li>
                    <li>Upgrade blue/purple heroes ONLY on Thursday (for gathering speed skills)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Critical warning:</strong> Do NOT spend enhancement alloys on purple/blue equipment. Save all alloys for orange equipment only.</p>
                <p><strong>Where to get Power Cores:</strong> Tent event rewards (up to 250), Military shop (1,000 — only after all 5 heroes have orange equipment).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Day 5 (Friday): Holistic Growth</h3>
                <p><strong>What gives points:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any speed-up (construction, research, training)</li>
                    <li>Training/assembling/promoting units</li>
                    <li>Radar tasks</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Main focus: Training troops</li>
                    <li><strong>Use training speed-ups ONLY on Friday</strong></li>
                    <li>Save radar tasks from Thursday</li>
                    <li>Keep training daily, but save speed-ups for Friday</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Don't train extra troops after Saturday battle losses. You might lose them and have nothing to train next Friday.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Day 6 (Saturday): Enemy Buster</h3>
                <p><strong>What gives points:</strong></p>

                    <li>Defeating enemy units</li>
                    <li>Your units getting killed in battle</li>

                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easiest event!</strong></li>
                    <li>Ask enemies for tank vs tank battles</li>
                    <li>Or just attack and destroy</li>
                    <li><strong>AVOID using bounty refresh tickets</strong> — save them for Tuesday</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If low on points, just go kill. It's the simplest solution.</p>

                <li><strong>Without max research:</strong> Much less — prioritize this research!</li>
                <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 830 medals per day × 2 (double rewards) × 5 days = 8,300 badges</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> Building and Research days might only give 3M points, reducing total slightly</li>

                <li><strong>Save resources</strong> — Spend only on the right days</li>
                <li><strong>Sync with Full Preparedness</strong> — System time 8 and 20</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritize Alliance Recognition research</strong> — Double rewards, more badges</li>
                <li><strong>Don't chase 6 million blindly</strong> — Stop at 3 million if resources low</li>
                <li><strong>Be patient</strong> — This is a long-term grind, not a sprint</li>
                <li><strong>Refresh tickets</strong> — Save for Tuesday (Shelter Upgrade) only</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancement alloys</strong> — Orange equipment only, never purple/blue</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the most important research for Alliance Duel?</h3>
                <p>Alliance Recognition research. It doubles your daily rewards (badges, alloys, fragments) and unlocks chests 7-9. Requires about 143-200k badges to fully max.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When should I use speed-ups?</h3>
                <p>Construction speed-ups on Day 2 (Tuesday). Research speed-ups on Day 3 (Wednesday). Training speed-ups on Day 5 (Friday). Never use speed-ups randomly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is Full Preparedness sync?</h3>
                <p>Full Preparedness events run at system time 8 and 20. Do your upgrades during these times to score in both Alliance Duel AND Full Preparedness simultaneously.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I always aim for 6 million points?</h3>
                <p>No. Don't chase 6 million blindly. If you lack resources, stop at 3 million. Especially true for Day 2 (building) and Day 3 (research) — the hardest days.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How many badges can I get per week?</h3>
                <p>With maxed Alliance Recognition (double rewards), around 8,000 badges per week if you complete most daily chests.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Which day is easiest/hardest?</h3>
                <p>Easiest: Day 4 (Hero Initiative) and Day 6 (Enemy Buster). Hardest: Day 2 (Shelter Upgrade) and Day 3 (Age of Science) — speed-ups are scarce.</p>
