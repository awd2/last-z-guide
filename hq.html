            <h2>HQ Level = Hero Level Cap</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>The Formula</h3>
                <p>Every HQ level adds <strong>+5 to your hero level cap</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HQ 1 → Hero cap 5</li>
                    <li>HQ 20 → Hero cap 100</li>
                    <li>HQ 30 → Hero cap 150</li>
                    <li>HQ 35 → Hero cap 175</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Higher hero levels = massive power boost. Your arena performance, overall power, and combat strength all increase significantly. See our <a href="heroes.html">Hero Tier List</a> for which heroes to prioritize.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Future Content: T11 Units</h3>
                <p>T11 units are likely coming. When they arrive, only HQ35 players will be ready. Upgrade now to prepare for what's next.</p>

            <h2>Sophia — The Queen of Construction</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Why Sophia is Essential</h3>
                <p>Sophia's 3rd skill gives you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extra free construction duration</li>
                    <li>Faster construction speed</li>
                    <li><strong>At 4 stars:</strong> Resource cost -5%</li>
                    <li><strong>At 5 stars:</strong> Resource cost -10%</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "In a game where upgrading costs hundreds of millions and eventually billions, these discounts save you a mountain of resources. It's like having a personal accountant who actually knows what they're doing."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>The Rule</h3>
                <p><strong>"If you reach HQ30 without Sophia at 5 stars, something went wrong."</strong></p>
                <p>Her bonus applies to EVERY building. Since you upgrade tons of buildings to reach HQ35, Sophia saves resources at every step. Push her to 5 stars as early as possible.</p>

            <h2>HQ Progression Phases</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 1: HQ 1-18 (Fast & Easy)</h3>
                <p>Upgrading is smooth, fast, and cheap. You feel like a building genius.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can be done in <strong>a few days</strong></li>
                    <li>With bonuses: <strong>less than 2 days</strong> possible</li>
                    <li>Barely costs anything</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't slow down here. Rush through these levels.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 2: HQ 18-24 (Reality Check)</h3>
                <p>Upgrade times get longer. Some take a week or more. Resource costs "punch you in the face."</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Take advantage of early game chaos. Loot weaker players while you can. Don't tie yourself into too many peace treaties early.</p>
                <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "The game before Season 1 is all about alliance domination. Pick the right team and start climbing."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 3: HQ 24-27 (Smart Play Required)</h3>
                <p>Things slow down significantly. You'll feel it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saving speedups becomes crucial</li>
                    <li>Only upgrade buildings required for next HQ</li>
                    <li>Don't waste resources on random buildings just because they glow with a blue arrow</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Priority:</strong> HQ first, then only required support buildings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 4: HQ 30 (Major Milestone)</h3>
                <p>Congratulations — this is one of the biggest milestones in the game!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Required for T10 troops — see <a href="research.html">Research Priority</a> for tech requirements</li>
                    <li>If HQ31-35 isn't unlocked yet, use this time to prepare</li>
                    <li>Stack resources, speedups, construction bonuses</li>
                    <li>Upgrade Hall of Honor and formation buildings for power boosts</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Phase 5: HQ 31-35 (The Journey)</h3>
                <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Upgrading from 30 to 35 — that's not just an upgrade. That's a journey, a pilgrimage, a test of patience, resources, and how many times you can shout at your screen."</p>
                <p>These levels are brutally expensive and require a new resource: <strong>Steel</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Some upgrades take <strong>over 6 months</strong> without bonuses. "You could grow a small real-life garden in that time."</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Steel — The New Resource</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>When Steel Appears</h3>
                <p>Steel only exists after reaching HQ30. Before that, the game acts like steel doesn't exist. Once you hit 30 and unlock the HQ31-35 update, steel suddenly appears everywhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>How to Get Steel</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build a <strong>Steel Mine</strong> in your town</li>
                    <li>Earn from <strong>Bounties</strong></li>
                    <li>Get from <strong>Fury Lord</strong></li>
                    <li>Buy in <strong>Hub Shop</strong></li>
                    <li>Season 4 events</li>
                    <li><strong>Best method:</strong> Orange Bounties (very large amounts)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>The Special Event</h3>
                <p>Around Season 3, right after the HQ31-35 update, there's a special event to help players climb from 30 to 31. You earn lots of steel just for daily tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Make absolutely sure you take advantage of that event. The steel makes HQ31 much easier.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Steel Is NOT the Problem</h3>
                <p>Steel is easy to collect with orange bounties. Resources are manageable with the new vault system (hundreds of millions per week possible).</p>
                <p><strong>The real bottleneck:</strong> Speedups. Those will stop you, not steel or resources.</p>

            <h2>Alliance Duel Day 2 Strategy</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>The Pro Tip</h3>
                <p><strong>Keep your HQ upgrade ready, but do NOT finish it until Alliance Duel Day 2.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start the upgrade anytime</li>
                    <li>When it's ready, you'll see a green checkmark</li>
                    <li><strong>That is the most dangerous button in the game</strong></li>
                    <li>One accidental tap = points gone forever</li>
                    <li>Hold until Day 2, then complete for massive points</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Double Bonus</h3>
                <p>Try to align HQ completion with <strong>Full Preparedness</strong> on the same day. You get bonus points from both sides. Learn more in our <a href="alliance-duel.html">Alliance Duel Guide</a>.</p>

                    <li><strong>Villa</strong> — gives construction bonuses</li>

                <h3>Consistent Pattern</h3>
                <p>From HQ8 to HQ30, <strong>Laboratory is mandatory</strong> for every upgrade.</p>
                <p>Key buildings that must always be kept up:</p>

                    <li>Resource production buildings (tempting but slow you down)</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the max HQ level in Last Z?</h3>
                <p>Level 35 on older servers. Newer states stay at 30 until Season 3 update. Each HQ level adds +5 to hero level cap (HQ35 = hero cap 175).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I get steel in Last Z?</h3>
                <p>Steel only appears after HQ30. Best sources: <a href="tyrant.html">Tyrant rallies</a> (main source), orange bounties (most steel per bounty), steel mine, Fury Lord, hub shop, Season 4 events. A special event after HQ31-35 update gives huge steel.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why is Sophia important for HQ upgrades?</h3>
                <p>Her 3rd skill reduces ALL building costs by 10% at 5 stars and speeds up construction. In a game with billion-cost upgrades, this saves massive resources on every building.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long does it take to reach HQ35?</h3>
                <p>Without bonuses, some final upgrades take 6+ months EACH. With full construction speed setup (villa, refugees, Sophia, alliance buffs), it's much faster. Speedups are the main bottleneck.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the Alliance Duel HQ strategy?</h3>
                <p>Keep HQ upgrade ready but don't complete until Day 2. The green checkmark is dangerous — one accidental tap wastes all points. Hold until Day 2, align with Full Preparedness for double bonus.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is it worth upgrading past HQ30?</h3>
                <p>Yes, 100%. Each level unlocks +5 hero levels = massive free power. HQ35 heroes reach level 175. Also prepares you for T11 units which will require HQ35.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What buildings are required for each HQ level?</h3>
                <p>Laboratory is mandatory from HQ8 to HQ30. Key buildings: City Walls, Alliance Center, Assault Camp, Shooter Camp, Rider Camp. Pattern is consistent to HQ35.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When do HQ levels 31-35 unlock?</h3>
                <p>Usually around Season 3. The update adds steel as a new resource and a special event helps players climb from 30 to 31 with bonus steel rewards.</p>
