            <h2>What is Lucky Discounter?</h2>
            <p>Lucky Discounter is a recurring event (every ~4 weeks) where you can purchase items at random discounts. The key is that certain attempts <strong>guarantee</strong> 90% off, making this the best event for farming badges.</p>

            <p><strong>Why badges matter:</strong> Badges are required for <a href="research.html">Alliance Recognition research</a>, which unlocks medal production, hero training speed, and other critical bonuses. You need tens of thousands of badges to complete this research tree.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Guaranteed 90% Discount Attempts</h2>
            <p>These attempts ALWAYS give 90% off — no luck involved:</p>

            <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>

                        <th>Discount</th>
                        <th>Tickets Needed</th>

                </tbody>

            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Save tickets until you have enough to reach at least the 9th attempt (two guaranteed 90% discounts).</p>

            <p><strong>Key rule:</strong> Never buy speedups below 90% discount — VIP shop prices are similar or better. Badges can be bought at 50%+ if you have excess diamonds. For another diamond event, check out <a href="gacha-go.html">Gacha Go</a> for Golden Wrenches.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Price Comparison: Lucky Discounter vs VIP Shop</h2>

            <h3>Badges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VIP Shop:</strong> 100 badges for 150 diamonds = 1.5 diamonds/badge</li>
                <li><strong>Lucky Discounter 90%:</strong> 2,000 badges for 600 diamonds = 0.3 diamonds/badge</li>
                <li><strong>Savings:</strong> 5x better value at 90% discount</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Speedups</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>VIP Shop:</strong> ~32 hours for 1,700 diamonds</li>
                <li><strong>Lucky Discounter 50%:</strong> 15 hours for 900 diamonds (similar to VIP)</li>
                <li><strong>Lucky Discounter 90%:</strong> 25 hours for 900 diamonds (much better)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Only speedups at 90% beat VIP shop. Badges are always better in Lucky Discounter at 50%+.</p>

            <h2>Ticket Saving Strategy</h2>
            <p>Refresh tickets accumulate between events. The optimal approach:</p>

            <h3>Minimum Viable (9 tickets)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Guarantees two 90% discounts (5th and 9th)</li>
                <li>Good for F2P with limited patience</li>
                <li>Accumulates in ~2 months</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Recommended (18 tickets)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Guarantees three 90% discounts (5th, 9th, 18th)</li>
                <li>Best balance of waiting vs rewards</li>
                <li>Accumulates in ~4-5 months</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Maximum Value (32 tickets)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Guarantees four 90% discounts (5th, 9th, 18th, 32nd)</li>
                <li>Requires ~8 months of saving</li>
                <li>Best for patient endgame players</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You get roughly 4-5 tickets per event cycle. Save them until you hit your target number.</p>

                <li><strong>Building speedups:</strong> ~210 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Research speedups:</strong> Large amount</li>
                <li><strong>Cost per badge:</strong> ~0.73 diamonds</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Compare to VIP shop: 42,000 badges would cost 63,000 diamonds (1.5 per badge). Lucky Discounter saved over 32,000 diamonds.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Strategy</h2>

            <h3>1. Accumulate Tickets</h3>
            <p>Don't use refresh tickets when you get them. Save until you have at least 9 (ideally 18 or 32).</p>

            <h3>2. Prepare Diamonds</h3>
            <p>Before the event, collect diamonds from all sources. You'll need 30,000-80,000 depending on how many tickets you have.</p>

            <h3>3. Use Free Attempt First</h3>
            <p>Always start with the free attempt. Check the discount before deciding to buy.</p>

            <h3>4. Skip Low Discounts</h3>
            <p>If you get 10% or 30%, just refresh and move on. Don't waste diamonds on poor rates.</p>

            <h3>5. Buy Everything at 90%</h3>
            <p>When you hit guaranteed 90% attempts (5th, 9th, 18th, 32nd), buy ALL badges and speedups available.</p>

            <h3>6. Buy Badges at 70%</h3>
            <p>70% is still excellent value for badges. Purchase badges but skip speedups at this rate.</p>

            <h3>7. Optional: 50% Badges</h3>
            <p>If you have excess diamonds and need badges urgently, 50% is acceptable. Never buy speedups at 50%.</p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Buying speedups at 50% or less:</strong> VIP shop is the same price or cheaper</li>
                <li><strong>Using tickets immediately:</strong> Save them for bulk purchasing</li>
                <li><strong>Buying at 10-30% discount:</strong> Terrible value, always skip</li>
                <li><strong>Not preparing diamonds:</strong> You need diamonds ready when 90% hits</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring the event:</strong> This is THE best source of cheap badges</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Focus on Badges?</h2>
            <p>Badges fuel Alliance Recognition research, which provides:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Medal production (for hero upgrades)</li>
                <li>Hero training speed bonuses</li>
                <li>Alliance buffs and bonuses</li>
                <li>Critical late-game power multipliers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You'll need 50,000-100,000+ badges to complete Alliance Recognition research. Lucky Discounter is the fastest F2P path to accumulating them. Use badges strategically during <a href="alliance-duel.html">Alliance Duel</a> Day 3 for maximum value.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>How often does Lucky Discounter appear?</summary>
                <p>Approximately every 4 weeks. Plan your ticket saving around this schedule.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Do refresh tickets expire?</summary>
                <p>No, tickets carry over between events. You can save them for months.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Should I buy training speedups?</summary>
                <p>Only at 90% discount. Training speedups are less critical than building/research speedups.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What if I don't have enough diamonds when 90% appears?</summary>
                <p>This is why preparation matters. Collect diamonds before the event starts. Missing a 90% discount is a significant loss.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Is 50% discount worth it for badges?</summary>
                <p>Yes, if you have lots of diamonds and urgently need badges. It's still better than VIP shop prices.</p>
