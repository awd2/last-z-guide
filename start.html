            <h2>Step-by-Step Beginner's Guide</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Complete the Tutorial</h3>
                <p>The tutorial teaches you basic controls, combat mechanics, and base building. <strong>Don't skip it</strong> — completing the tutorial gives you free resources, heroes, and unlocks essential features. Takes about 10-15 minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Focus on Main Quests</h3>
                <p>The main quest line (shown on the left side of your screen) is your roadmap. Following it unlocks new buildings, heroes, and game modes. Side activities like exploration can wait until you've established your base.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Join an Active Alliance</h3>
                <p>Alliances provide huge benefits: resource help, alliance gifts, group events, and protection. Look for an alliance with active members (check recent activity). Don't stay in a dead alliance — switch if needed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Upgrade Your Base</h3>
                <p>Your Command Center limits everything else. Prioritize it, then focus on resource buildings (farms, sawmills). A strong economy early means faster growth later. Use speed-ups wisely on long upgrades. See our <a href="hq.html">HQ Upgrade Guide</a> for details.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Save Premium Currency</h3>
                <p>Diamonds are valuable. Don't waste them on speeding up timers or random chests. Save for: guaranteed hero summons, important events like <a href="lucky-discounter.html">Lucky Discounter</a>, and VIP upgrades. Patience pays off.</p>

                <li>Complete daily and weekly missions for consistent resource income</li>
                <li>Don't upgrade all heroes — focus on 5-6 main heroes first (see <a href="heroes.html">Hero Tier List</a>)</li>
