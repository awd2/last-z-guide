## Topic Proposals

### research-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Research Guide — Best Research Order, Peace Shield, and T10 Path
- Target: `research.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Helps players find the best research order, Peace Shield context, and T10 path faster, improving query match and first-screen usefulness.

Rationale:

This is a high-value existing-page opportunity with strong search demand, clear intent, and a page already positioned as the Research cornerstone. The proposal stays within the approved template and preserves canonical claims, so it is suitable for human review as an update rather than a new page. Prior run `2026-05-12-research-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Low; the topic maps to the existing Research cornerstone and does not require a new intent page if scope stays tight.

Expected route:

- index.html
- research.html
- research-costs.html

Claims to verify:

- The search intent is not already better served by another canonical page.
- Any rewrite can preserve research-best-mainline, hero-training-cockpit-stop, peace-shield-value, and research-atlas-role.
- The update can be made without blurring cluster role separation.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: research.html had 13619 impressions, 670 clicks, 4.92% CTR, avg position 7.16.
- Rising query: `last z research guide` gained 11 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.
- Rising query: `last z urgent rescue` gained 8 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.
- Rising query: `urgent rescue last z` gained 3 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.

}
```

Next step:

Send to human review for scope definition against the protected canonical claims and confirm no role overlap with related Research pages.

### index-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Guides — Research, Events, HQ, Heroes, and F2P Strategy
- Target: `index.html`
- Cluster: `Home`
- Action: `update_existing`
- Archetype: `home-hub`
- Priority: `high`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `true`

Player value:

Improves landing-page usefulness for users looking for the main guide hub and helps them reach the correct cluster faster.

Rationale:

The home page has a broad navigational role and a real search signal. This is a reasonable candidate for improving entry guidance and query-to-page fit without changing the site structure.

Duplication risk:

Low; the page is already the canonical home hub and should not be replaced by a new page.

Expected route:

- index.html

Claims to verify:

- The home page is the best target for the observed queries.
- Any changes stay within the existing home-hub pattern.
- The update does not blur cluster role separation.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: index.html had 10947 impressions, 823 clicks, 7.52% CTR, avg position 6.64.
- Rising query: `last z research guide` gained 11 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.
- Rising query: `lastzguides.com` gained 3 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.

  "notes": "The home page has a broad navigational role and a real search signal. This is a reasonable candidate for improving entry guidance and query-to-page fit without changing the site structure."
}
```

Next step:

Have a human review the proposed home-hub adjustments to make sure they do not dilute navigation hierarchy or collide with other canonical pages.

### codes-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Redeem Codes — Active Codes, Gift Center Login, and UID
- Target: `codes.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Improves discoverability for players searching for redeem codes, Gift Center login, and UID-related help.

Rationale:

This is a strong existing-page refinement opportunity on a cornerstone Economy page with clear query signals around Gift Center and redeem flow intent. It is suitable for human review because the proposal can likely be handled as a scope-limited update. Prior run `2026-05-05-codes-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium; there is some risk that this intent is already handled by another canonical page, so role separation needs review.

Expected route:

- index.html
- codes.html

Claims to verify:

- The query intent is not already better served by another canonical page.
- The update can preserve gift-center-only-redeem-flow, gift-rewards-mailbox, and gift-center-cluster-role-separation.
- The change stays within the approved cornerstone scope.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: codes.html had 33220 impressions, 586 clicks, 1.76% CTR, avg position 6.11.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center` had 3075 impressions, 113 clicks, 3.67% CTR, position 6.83.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center login` had 943 impressions, 43 clicks, 4.56% CTR, position 5.41.
- Low CTR query: `lastz gift center` had 555 impressions, 23 clicks, 4.14% CTR, position 6.37.
- Low CTR query: `last-z.com gift center` had 479 impressions, 22 clicks, 4.59% CTR, position 6.00.

Next step:

Review against adjacent Economy pages to confirm the page owns this intent and that protected claims remain intact.

### external-gift-center-official-flow-validation

- Title: External source opportunity: official Gift Center and store flow validation
- Target: `gift-center-uid.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `support-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Monitor only until the official flow claims are cross-validated. The proposal relies on a single external source and must not advance without owner confirmation or another reliable source. Future trigger: Move to review only after independent verification of Gift Center routing and UID flow against canonical site memory plus at least one additional reliable source.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- gift-center-uid.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Official service domain is the strongest source for Gift Center routing and redeem/store flow validation.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: HQ and progression requirement cross-check
- Target: `hq.html`
- Cluster: `Progression`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Monitor only. The external reference may be useful for discovery, but it is not enough to justify public progression claims or copy changes. Future trigger: Revisit if HQ requirement details are confirmed by owner review or another reliable source.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- hq.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved wiki/reference source can reveal HQ and progression planning gaps.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-research-costs-external-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: research cost and branch coverage cross-check
- Target: `research-costs.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `atlas-page`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Monitor only. This is a discovery signal, not a sufficient basis for a user-facing research-costs update. Future trigger: Reconsider after branch names, costs, and coverage gaps are verified by a second source or owner confirmation.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- research-costs.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved research reference source can reveal branch coverage gaps and cost/name drift.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### vehicle-modification-cost-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Vehicle Modification Costs — Wrenches, Milestones, and Unlock Path
- Target: `vehicle-modification-cost.html`
- Cluster: `Equipment`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cost-page`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Useful but lower-priority than the Research, Home, and Codes opportunities. It can be monitored for sustained demand before committing human review bandwidth. Future trigger: Promote if the query set shows continued intent concentration around vehicle upgrade costs or if a related content gap is confirmed.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- gear.html
- vehicle-modification-cost.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: vehicle-modification-cost.html had 7319 impressions, 480 clicks, 6.56% CTR, avg position 5.82.

### alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Alliance Duel Guide — Schedule, Day 1–6 Plan, and VS Strategy
- Target: `alliance-duel.html`
- Cluster: `Events`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `event-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `medium`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Useful but not as strong as the top existing-page opportunities. The event intent appears actionable, but the current signal is less distinctive and may overlap with broader Events coverage. Future trigger: Promote if event-related queries continue to grow or if a human confirms a distinct schedule-focused player job. Prior run `2026-05-10-alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:
