## Topic Proposals

### codes-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Redeem Codes — Active Codes, Gift Center Login, and UID
- Target: `codes.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Helps players find the correct redeem path faster, reduces confusion around Gift Center login and UID, and better matches search intent.

Rationale:

This is a high-signal, high-volume query-page mismatch on an existing cornerstone page with clear intent around redeem codes and Gift Center login. It fits the Economy cluster and can likely improve first-screen usefulness without changing site structure. Prior run `2026-05-05-codes-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium. The page already owns this topic space, so changes must preserve cluster role separation and avoid overlapping with other canonical pages.

Expected route:

- index.html
- codes.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether codes.html remains the best canonical page for all Gift Center related queries.
- Whether the existing canonical claims about redeem flow, mailbox rewards, and cluster role separation remain accurate and should be preserved unchanged.
- Whether any query variants require new first-screen structure rather than broader page rewrites.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: codes.html had 40033 impressions, 733 clicks, 1.83% CTR, avg position 6.01.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center` had 3169 impressions, 121 clicks, 3.82% CTR, position 6.58.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center login` had 903 impressions, 46 clicks, 5.09% CTR, position 5.14.
- Low CTR query: `lastz gift center` had 683 impressions, 29 clicks, 4.25% CTR, position 5.96.
- Low CTR query: `last-z.com gift center` had 508 impressions, 25 clicks, 4.92% CTR, position 6.00.

}
```

Next step:

Human review should validate which query intents are already covered, confirm the canonical claims to preserve, and define a scoped update brief for the existing page only.

### alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Alliance Duel Guide — Schedule, Day 1–6 Plan, and VS Strategy
- Target: `alliance-duel.html`
- Cluster: `Events`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `event-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `medium`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Improves schedule discovery and day-by-day planning for players searching for alliance duel timing and strategy.

Rationale:

This is a strong existing-page opportunity with meaningful impressions and a reasonable CTR gap, pointing to query-to-page refinement rather than new content creation. It fits the Events cluster and appears suitable for a scoped update to the current guide. Prior run `2026-05-10-alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium. The topic should not be expanded into a broader events hub if another canonical page already serves that role.

Expected route:

- index.html
- events.html
- alliance-duel.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether alliance-duel.html is still the best canonical page for last z vs schedule intent.
- Whether the proposed schedule and day 1-6 framing is accurate and current.
- Whether another events page already serves this query better.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: alliance-duel.html had 8912 impressions, 434 clicks, 4.87% CTR, avg position 6.10.

}
```

Next step:

Human review should confirm the target intent, verify whether the page can absorb the missing schedule and strategy context without breaking cluster separation, and define the minimal update scope.

### external-gift-center-official-flow-validation

- Title: External source opportunity: official Gift Center and store flow validation
- Target: `gift-center-uid.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `support-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

External source discovery only. The claim set depends on a single outside source and cannot be treated as proof without cross-validation and owner confirmation. Future trigger: Move forward only if canonical site memory plus at least one additional reliable source confirms the Gift Center routing and UID flow.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- gift-center-uid.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Official service domain is the strongest source for Gift Center routing and redeem/store flow validation.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: HQ and progression requirement cross-check
- Target: `hq.html`
- Cluster: `Progression`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Useful as a validation lead, but it is not yet verified enough for a content proposal. It also risks overlapping with existing HQ coverage. Future trigger: Advance only after the progression requirements and dependencies are confirmed from a second reliable source or owner review. Prior run `2026-05-16-external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- hq.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved wiki/reference source can reveal HQ and progression planning gaps.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-research-costs-external-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: research cost and branch coverage cross-check
- Target: `research-costs.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `atlas-page`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Discovery signal only. External reference content about research costs and branch coverage needs verification before any page work. Future trigger: Reconsider if branch naming, costs, or coverage gaps are confirmed by canonical memory plus a reliable second source. Prior run `2026-05-16-external-research-costs-external-cross-check-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- research-costs.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved research reference source can reveal branch coverage gaps and cost/name drift.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-search-lastz-fandom-reference-full-preparedness-last-z-survival-shooter--4

- Title: External search opportunity: Full Preparedness | Last Z: Survival Shooter Wiki | Fandom
- Target: `events.html`
- Cluster: `Events`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Search-result evidence is too thin and source wording must not be copied. It is also likely to overlap with existing events coverage. Future trigger: Revisit if the event mechanics and hero task linkage are verified through reliable sources and the page gap is clearly distinct.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- events.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Regular world event that includes research-speed tasks under the Age of Science cycle and hero upgrade tasks under Hero Initiative.

### external-search-lastz-fandom-reference-heroes-last-z-survival-shooter-wiki-fandom-5

- Title: External search opportunity: Heroes | Last Z: Survival Shooter Wiki | Fandom
- Target: `research.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Discovery-only, with high duplication risk against existing heroes or research pages. Not ready for human review as a proposal. Future trigger: Reconsider if a distinct player job emerges that is not already served by heroes.html or research.html.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- research.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Core hero roster and power overview; useful for linking hero-related event tasks to hero leveling and fragments.
