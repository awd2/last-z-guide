## Topic Proposals

### alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Alliance Duel Guide — Schedule, Day 1–6 Plan, and VS Strategy
- Target: `alliance-duel.html`
- Cluster: `Events`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `event-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `medium`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Better schedule and strategy help for players searching for Last Z Alliance Duel timing and planning guidance.

Rationale:

This is a strong page-level opportunity with clear GSC signals, a specific target page, and a defined user job. It fits the existing Events cluster and likely improves query-to-page match without needing a new page. Prior run `2026-05-10-alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium, because event intent may overlap with other Events pages if cluster separation is not carefully preserved.

Expected route:

- index.html
- events.html
- alliance-duel.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether alliance-duel.html is still the best canonical page for the query set
- Whether the proposed improvements can be made without expanding beyond approved scope
- Whether any competing Events page already covers this intent better

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: alliance-duel.html had 8912 impressions, 434 clicks, 4.87% CTR, avg position 6.10.

Next step:

Send to human review for scope check against events cluster pages and confirm the update can stay within the current event-guide template.

### codes-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Redeem Codes — Active Codes, Gift Center Login, and UID
- Target: `codes.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Helps players find the correct redeem path, Gift Center login guidance, and UID details faster.

Rationale:

This is the highest-signal opportunity because the page already has substantial impressions and several low-CTR Gift Center queries. The intent is clear, the target page is established, and the page is already known to have prior CTR work history. Prior run `2026-05-05-codes-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium to high, because the page must preserve cluster role separation and canonical claims around redeem flow and mailbox behavior.

Expected route:

- index.html
- codes.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether codes.html remains the correct canonical page for gift center queries
- Whether all proposed changes stay within canonical claims for redeem flow, mailbox, and cluster role separation
- Whether the page already fully serves the intent of login and UID queries or needs only a limited update

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: codes.html had 40033 impressions, 733 clicks, 1.83% CTR, avg position 6.01.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center` had 3169 impressions, 121 clicks, 3.82% CTR, position 6.58.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center login` had 903 impressions, 46 clicks, 5.09% CTR, position 5.14.
- Low CTR query: `lastz gift center` had 683 impressions, 29 clicks, 4.25% CTR, position 5.96.
- Low CTR query: `last-z.com gift center` had 508 impressions, 25 clicks, 4.92% CTR, position 6.00.

Next step:

### external-gift-center-official-flow-validation

- Title: External source opportunity: official Gift Center and store flow validation
- Target: `gift-center-uid.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `support-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Useful discovery signal, but it depends on a single external source and risks copying competitor or service wording. Needs verification before it can become a content opportunity. Future trigger: Move only after owner confirmation plus at least one additional reliable source validates the flow and public claims.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- gift-center-uid.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Official service domain is the strongest source for Gift Center routing and redeem/store flow validation.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: HQ and progression requirement cross-check
- Target: `hq.html`
- Cluster: `Progression`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

This is external-source discovery only and is not ready for content action without independent verification. Future trigger: Revisit after the HQ and progression claims are checked against canonical memory and a second reliable source. Prior run `2026-05-16-external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- hq.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved wiki/reference source can reveal HQ and progression planning gaps.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-research-costs-external-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: research cost and branch coverage cross-check
- Target: `research-costs.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `atlas-page`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Valuable as a research signal, but it is still source-dependent and could drift into copy or unsupported claims. Future trigger: Review again when branch names, costs, and progression data are cross-validated by another reliable source or owner confirmation. Prior run `2026-05-16-external-research-costs-external-cross-check-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- research-costs.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved research reference source can reveal branch coverage gaps and cost/name drift.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

- Title: External search opportunity: Full Preparedness
- Target: `events.html`
- Cluster: `Events`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

The topic is too dependent on an external fandom-style source and the evidence is not enough to support a public content change. Future trigger: Consider only if the event topic is confirmed by canonical game knowledge and a second source, and if no better Events page already covers it.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- events.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Daily event cycles include an Age of Science theme for technology research and a Hero Initiative theme for hero upgrades and recruitment tickets.

### external-search-lastzwiki-reference-heroes-last-z-wiki-tier-list-stats-complet-1

- Title: External search opportunity: Heroes - Last Z Wiki | Tier List, Stats & Complete Character Guide 2026
- Target: `heroes.html`
- Cluster: `Heroes`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

This is a source-discovery result that likely duplicates or overlaps with broader hero guide intent, and it is not yet safe for content planning. Future trigger: Reconsider after checking for an existing hero hub or a clearly distinct player job that is not already covered.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- heroes.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Core hero directory with faction filters, hero roster, levels, and equipment details; useful for hero identity and build cross-checking.
