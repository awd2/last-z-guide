## Topic Proposals

### codes-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Redeem Codes — Active Codes, Gift Center Login, and UID
- Target: `codes.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Improves the match between a high-demand search query set and the existing redeem codes page, making it easier for players to find the correct flow, login context, and active code information.

Rationale:

This is the highest-confidence opportunity because it is grounded in first-party search signals, maps to an existing cornerstone page, and has clear user intent around gift center and redeem code queries. The page already exists, so the best path is an update rather than a new page, provided the change preserves canonical claims and cluster separation. Prior run `2026-05-05-codes-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium. The topic overlaps with other economy pages if scope expands beyond redeem flow, but the existing route and canonical claims reduce the risk.

Expected route:

- index.html
- codes.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether the query intent is best served by codes.html and not another canonical page
- Whether any proposed on-page changes can be made without blurring cluster roles
- Whether current gift center claims remain accurate and unchanged

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: codes.html had 33220 impressions, 586 clicks, 1.76% CTR, avg position 6.11.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center` had 3075 impressions, 113 clicks, 3.67% CTR, position 6.83.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center login` had 943 impressions, 43 clicks, 4.56% CTR, position 5.41.
- Low CTR query: `lastz gift center` had 555 impressions, 23 clicks, 4.14% CTR, position 6.37.
- Low CTR query: `last-z.com gift center` had 479 impressions, 22 clicks, 4.59% CTR, position 6.00.

}

Next step:

Send to human review with a narrow scope focused on query intent alignment, first-screen usefulness, and protection of canonical claims.

### external-gift-center-official-flow-validation

- Title: External source opportunity: official Gift Center and store flow validation
- Target: `gift-center-uid.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `support-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Useful as a cross-validation lead, but the proposal depends on external-source verification and should not advance without stronger confirmation. It also overlaps existing economy routing topics. Future trigger: Advance only if the official service flow is verified against canonical memory plus at least one additional reliable source or owner confirmation.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- gift-center-uid.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Official service domain is the strongest source for Gift Center routing and redeem/store flow validation.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: HQ and progression requirement cross-check
- Target: `hq.html`
- Cluster: `Progression`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Potentially useful for verification, but it is external-source driven and high risk for duplication or unverified claims about HQ progression. Future trigger: Revisit if the HQ and dependency model is confirmed from multiple reliable sources or owner knowledge. Prior run `2026-05-16-external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- hq.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved wiki/reference source can reveal HQ and progression planning gaps.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-research-costs-external-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: research cost and branch coverage cross-check
- Target: `research-costs.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `atlas-page`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Research cost and branch coverage ideas are valuable discovery signals, but they are not yet ready for a human review proposal because they rely on external validation and may duplicate existing research coverage. Future trigger: Revisit when cost and branch drift can be verified against canonical memory and a second reliable source. Prior run `2026-05-16-external-research-costs-external-cross-check-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- research-costs.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved research reference source can reveal branch coverage gaps and cost/name drift.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-search-lastz-fandom-reference-full-preparedness-last-z-survival-shooter--4

- Title: External search opportunity: Full Preparedness | Last Z: Survival Shooter Wiki | Fandom
- Target: `events.html`
- Cluster: `Events`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Search result content about events and hero initiative is too thin and source-dependent to move forward now. It needs stronger verification and clearer differentiation from existing events coverage. Future trigger: Revisit if the event mechanics are confirmed by canonical memory and another reliable source.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- events.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Daily event with a Hero Initiative phase that uses Hero XP, fragments, and recruitment tickets; also includes Age of Science for research speed-ups.

- Title: External search opportunity: Heroes | Last Z: Survival Shooter Wiki | Fandom
- Target: `research.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

This is a broad hero overview search signal, but it is too close to existing heroes coverage and may duplicate current intent without a clearly distinct player job. Future trigger: Revisit if a specific gap appears, such as an unserved hero naming or gear taxonomy issue.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- research.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Core hero overview page covering hero classes, power factors, and hero-related progression.
