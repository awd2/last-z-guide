## Topic Proposals

### index-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Guides — Research, Events, HQ, Heroes, and F2P Strategy
- Target: `index.html`
- Cluster: `Home`
- Action: `update_existing`
- Archetype: `home-hub`
- Priority: `high`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `true`

Player value:

Better first-screen usefulness and faster routing for players searching for the main guide hub.

Rationale:

High-impression home page with rising branded and research-related queries suggests a real navigation and query-match opportunity. The page already serves as the main hub, so an existing-page update is the correct path for human review.

Duplication risk:

Low, because this is a hub page update rather than a new intent target.

Expected route:

- index.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether the rising queries represent durable demand rather than short-term noise.
- Whether the current home page already covers the strongest hub intent better than any other canonical page.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: index.html had 10947 impressions, 823 clicks, 7.52% CTR, avg position 6.64.
- Rising query: `last z research guide` gained 11 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.
- Rising query: `lastzguides.com` gained 3 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.

}
```

Next step:

Review the current home template against the query set and confirm whether a limited homepage refinement can improve routing without changing cluster roles.

### research-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Research Guide — Best Research Order, Peace Shield, and T10 Path
- Target: `research.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Improved guidance for research order, peace shield value, and urgent rescue planning.

Rationale:

The Research cornerstone has strong impressions, moderate CTR, and rising research-guide and urgent-rescue queries. This is a high-value cornerstone update opportunity, but it must preserve protected claims and cluster role boundaries. Prior run `2026-05-12-research-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium, because adjacent research and progression topics can overlap if scope is not controlled.

Expected route:

- index.html
- research.html
- research-costs.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether urgent rescue belongs on the Research page or another canonical page.
- Whether the protected canonical claims remain accurate and in scope.
- Whether the current content already satisfies the strongest research-guide intent.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: research.html had 13619 impressions, 670 clicks, 4.92% CTR, avg position 7.16.
- Rising query: `last z research guide` gained 11 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.
- Rising query: `last z urgent rescue` gained 8 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.
- Rising query: `urgent rescue last z` gained 3 impressions in the last 7-day comparison window.

}
```

Next step:

Human review should check whether the existing Research page can absorb the new query intent through targeted refinement without reassigning intent to other pages.

### codes-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Redeem Codes — Active Codes, Gift Center Login, and UID
- Target: `codes.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: `high`
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:

Cleaner access to redeem codes, gift center login help, and UID routing.

Rationale:

The Codes page shows strong visibility and a clear login-related query cluster. This is a credible existing-page refinement opportunity, especially for gift center and redeem flow intent, but it must not blur canonical role separation. Prior run `2026-05-05-codes-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:

Medium, because Gift Center and redeem-flow topics can overlap with related economy pages.

Expected route:

- index.html
- codes.html

Claims to verify:

- Whether the query set is better served by codes.html or gift-center-uid.html.
- Whether canonical claims about redeem flow and mailbox behavior still hold exactly as protected.

Evidence:

- GSC page signal: codes.html had 33220 impressions, 586 clicks, 1.76% CTR, avg position 6.11.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center` had 3075 impressions, 113 clicks, 3.67% CTR, position 6.83.
- Low CTR query: `last z gift center login` had 943 impressions, 43 clicks, 4.56% CTR, position 5.41.
- Low CTR query: `lastz gift center` had 555 impressions, 23 clicks, 4.14% CTR, position 6.37.
- Low CTR query: `last-z.com gift center` had 479 impressions, 22 clicks, 4.59% CTR, position 6.00.

Next step:

Review whether the page can better answer login and gift center queries without expanding beyond the approved cornerstone scope.

### external-gift-center-official-flow-validation

- Title: External source opportunity: official Gift Center and store flow validation
- Target: `gift-center-uid.html`
- Cluster: `Economy`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `support-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Useful as discovery, but it depends on a single external source and still needs verification against canonical memory plus another reliable source or owner confirmation. Do not advance as-is. Future trigger: Move forward only after independent verification of the official routing and UID claims.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- gift-center-uid.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Official service domain is the strongest source for Gift Center routing and redeem/store flow validation.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-hq-and-progression-reference-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: HQ and progression requirement cross-check
- Target: `hq.html`
- Cluster: `Progression`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cornerstone-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Single-source external reference only. The HQ and progression claim set is too sensitive to accept without additional verification and could easily duplicate existing progression intent. Future trigger: Revisit if owner confirmation or a second reliable source validates the progression requirements and dependency chain.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- hq.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved wiki/reference source can reveal HQ and progression planning gaps.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### external-research-costs-external-cross-check

- Title: External source opportunity: research cost and branch coverage cross-check
- Target: `research-costs.html`
- Cluster: `Research`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `atlas-page`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Single-source external research reference is not enough to prove cost-table drift or branch coverage issues, and it risks copying competitor framing. Future trigger: Revisit if multiple reliable sources confirm a real branch or cost mismatch.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- research-costs.html

Claims to verify:

- None

Evidence:

- Owner-approved research reference source can reveal branch coverage gaps and cost/name drift.
- External source URL recorded for later manual verification.

### vehicle-modification-cost-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Vehicle Modification Costs — Wrenches, Milestones, and Unlock Path
- Target: `vehicle-modification-cost.html`
- Cluster: `Equipment`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `cost-page`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `high`
- Prior review: `none`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Worth monitoring, but lower priority than the strongest hub and cornerstone updates. The signal is not strong enough to justify selection over higher-value pages. Future trigger: Revisit if CTR or query demand worsens, or if related vehicle upgrade queries grow materially.

Duplication risk:



Expected route:

- index.html
- gear.html

### alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity

- Title: GSC opportunity review: Last Z Alliance Duel Guide — Schedule, Day 1–6 Plan, and VS Strategy
- Target: `alliance-duel.html`
- Cluster: `Events`
- Action: `monitor`
- Archetype: `event-guide`
- Priority: `low`
- Risk: ``
- Confidence: `medium`
- Prior review: `closed`
- Human approval required: `false`

Player value:



Rationale:

Worth monitoring, but not selected because the current evidence is limited to a page signal and the opportunity is weaker than the highest-value hub and cornerstone updates. Future trigger: Revisit if event-schedule queries expand or if the duel page starts underperforming more sharply. Prior run `2026-05-10-alliance-duel-gsc-opportunity-llm-approved-intake` is `closed`; keep this topic in monitoring unless new evidence materially changes the opportunity.

Duplication risk:
