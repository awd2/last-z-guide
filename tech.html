            <h2>The AR Controversy — Should You Do It First?</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>The Debate</h3>
                <p><strong>Common advice:</strong> "Do AR first!"</p>
                <p><strong>Expert opinion:</strong> "Get your 9 chests on AR and leave that alone."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Why AR Is NOT Priority</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expensive as hell</strong> — last tier costs 20k+ badges just for double chest</li>
                    <li><strong>Weeks to break even</strong> — takes forever to recoup the badge investment</li>
                    <li><strong>Sets you back 2-3 months</strong> — while others get stronger, you're farming badges</li>
                    <li><strong>Half badges = twice as strong</strong> — same badges in combat trees make you much more powerful</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Are you willing to set yourself back 2-3 months, fall behind everyone, to finish Alliance Recognition? By the time you catch up, they're another 2 months ahead."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>When AR Makes Sense</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're a passive player</li>
                    <li>Your alliance carries you in combat</li>
                    <li>You just want to cap points during versus events</li>
                    <li>You're not the "centerfold" for Canyon Clash, SVS, Glory Wars</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you want to fight, AR is a waste. If you want to piggyback, AR is fine. See our <a href="research.html">Research Priority Guide</a> for the full breakdown.</p>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Optimal Tech Path for Combat Players</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Elite Troops</h3>
                <p>Finish Elite Troops to unlock Military Strategies. Required foundation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Hero Training → Cockpit Only</h3>
                <p><strong>Expert consensus:</strong> "Get to Cockpit, you're good for the time being."</p>
                <p>The extra attack after Cockpit is nice but not worth the badges. It's cheap and quick, but not a priority past Cockpit.</p>
                <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "I won't agree with maxing Hero Training. The extra attack is nice at the end, but I don't see it as necessary."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Military Strategies</h3>
                <p><strong>Why it's essential:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cheap — anyone can do it</li>
                    <li>HP boosts at the bottom (10-15% HP)</li>
                    <li>Required to unlock Peace Shield (45%) and Siege to Seize</li>
                    <li>Focus on your main troop type first</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you run one troop type, you don't need to finish the whole tree.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Peace Shield → Urgent Rescue</h3>
                <p><strong>Unanimous agreement:</strong> "Urgent Rescue in Peace Shield — get that done. Then move on."</p>
                <p>Urgent Rescue reduces unit deaths by 20%. It's the direct counter to enemy Annihilation. Essential for <a href="pvp.html">PvP</a> survival.</p>
                <p><strong>Unlock requirements:</strong> 45-50% Military Strategies + 50% Shelter Building</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Siege to Seize</h3>
                <p><strong>Why it's good:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relatively cheap</li>
                    <li>HP boost from Recharge Shield</li>
                    <li>Primary power for solo faction players</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Get Recharge Shield to level 10 on both Peace Shield AND Siege to Seize = 35-40% extra HP. "That's massive."</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>The HP Stacking Strategy</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Recharge Shield on Both Trees</h3>
                <p>Both Peace Shield and Siege to Seize have Recharge Shield research.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Military Strategies: 10-15% HP</li>
                    <li>Peace Shield Recharge Shield (10/10): +HP%</li>
                    <li>Siege to Seize Recharge Shield (10/10): +HP%</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Total:</strong> 35-40% extra HP when combined. "It's a game changer."</p>

                <h3>Expert Verdict: It's a Luxury</h3>
                <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annihilation 20/20 — nice for Buster days</li>

                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reality:</strong> "It is not necessary. Unless you're a whale past T10s, skip it."</p>

            <h2>Tech + Heroes = Power (They Stack!)</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Global Effects Stack with Tech</h3>
                <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> "Your heroes and your tech are conjoined at the hip."</p>
                <p>Blue heroes at 5-star have global effects that stack with tech bonuses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>William</strong> — Unit training speed (stacks with Quick Assembly in Siege to Seize)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fiona</strong> — +300 attack global (all troops, not faction-specific) — see <a href="heroes.html">Hero Tier List</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Giselle</strong> — Wood gathering speed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Real Example: Training Speed</h3>
                <p><strong>Default training time for 165 shooters:</strong> 2 days 13 hours 52 minutes</p>
                <p><strong>After tech + hero stacking:</strong> 10 hours 54 minutes</p>
                <p>That's a 6x reduction from global effects + tech combined.</p>
                <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "You got 3 blue heroes that if you max out their skill, that's a 30% training speed boost. And the percentages stack together."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Don't Ignore "Small" Percentages</h3>
                <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "When you're in that tech tree and it says 'plus 1%' — that's huge. You're adding that on top of everything else. I'll take that 1% or 2% all day long."</p>
                <p>Same applies to wall upgrades. People rush HQ but leave wall at 19. Every 1% stacks and makes you strong.</p>

                <p><strong>Expert advice:</strong> "At 27 you can stop and ride it. Once you get those T9 troops, that makes a big difference."</p>
                <p>Benefits of staying at lower HQ:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look unassuming — enemies underestimate you</li>
                    <li>Warehouse fills up — no need to loot</li>
                    <li>People attack you thinking easy target</li>
                    <li>Even T10s get surprised: "God damn, what happened?"</li>

                    <li><strong>Extra Lab</strong> — "Extra lab is a must. A must."</li>
                    <li><strong>Extra Builder</strong> — Essential for progression</li>
                    <li><strong>License Store items</strong> — All of them worth it (except Zent Plunder)</li>

                <h3>Skip: Zent Plunder ($50)</h3>
                <p><strong>Why it's not worth $50:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No diamonds included</li>
                    <li>Takes forever to cap Zent</li>
                    <li>Spreads out your gathering — less food/wood per run</li>
                    <li>You'll cap food/wood but still be farming Zent</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Stop at "Unlock Lab #2" in the license store. Don't go past that.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I do Alliance Recognition (AR) first?</h3>
                <p>No, unless you're passive and carried by alliance. Get 9 chests and move to combat trees. AR sets you back 2-3 months in power.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I max Hero Training?</h3>
                <p>No. Get to Cockpit and stop. Extra attack after Cockpit is not worth the badges.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's the best tech path for F2P?</h3>
                <p>Elite Troops → Hero Training (Cockpit) → Military Strategies → Peace Shield (Urgent Rescue) → Siege to Seize. Focus on HP stacking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is Fully Armed Alliance worth it?</h3>
                <p>It's a luxury. Annihilation and Move Out are nice but not necessary. Skip unless you're a whale past T10s.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Peace Shield or Siege to Seize first?</h3>
                <p>Peace Shield to Urgent Rescue first (essential). Then Siege to Seize. Get Recharge Shield to 10 on both for massive HP gains.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What HQ level should I stop at?</h3>
                <p>HQ27 with T9 troops is the sweet spot for trap accounts. HQ level alone doesn't matter — tech and heroes do.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What should F2P players buy?</h3>
                <p>Extra Lab (must buy), Extra Builder, License Store items up to Lab #2. Skip Zent Plunder ($50 not worth it).</p>

                <h3>The Three Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pay to Win</strong> — Whales, T10s, unlimited spending</li>
                    <li><strong>Free to Play</strong> — No money, pure grind</li>
                    <li><strong>Cheap to Play</strong> — "I'll put in a little money, but not break the bank"</li>
