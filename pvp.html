        <aside class="quick-answer">
            <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Win PvP by using faction counters (Wings of Dawn beats Blood Rose — the most common faction). Scout opponents before attacking (check kill count, not just power). Attack on Saturday when hospital capacity doubles. For events: Canyon Clash rewards teamwork over power, SVS requires state coordination, State Ruler can be kraken-dominated. Join a NAP alliance for protection.
        </aside>

        <section>
            <h2>The Faction Counter Triangle</h2>
            <p>This is the most important PvP knowledge in Last Z:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wings of Dawn</strong> → defeats → <strong>Blood Rose</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Guard of Order</strong> → defeats → <strong>Wings of Dawn</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Blood Rose</strong> → defeats → <strong>Guard of Order</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Most players focus on Blood Rose because it's the first faction released. By building Wings of Dawn, you counter the majority of players. A 120M Wings of Dawn formation can defeat a 130M Blood Rose formation.</p>

            <h3>Recommended Mixed Formation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 Wings of Dawn heroes</strong> — main faction for counter advantage</li>
                <li><strong>2 Blood Rose heroes</strong> — for synergy bonuses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Season 3 heroes give damage resistance when deployed with Season 2 heroes, combining faction advantage with stat bonuses.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Battle Preparation</h2>

            <h3>Scouting Your Opponent</h3>
            <p>Never attack blindly. Check these stats before engaging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kill count:</strong> Low kills = weak in actual combat (inflated power from buildings)</li>
                <li><strong>Hero power:</strong> Compare to yours</li>
                <li><strong>Modified vehicle power:</strong> Key combat stat</li>
                <li><strong>Tech power:</strong> Low tech = Alliance Recognition not maxed</li>
                <li><strong>Alliance:</strong> Avoid targets with strong alliance backup</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> High total power with low kills means inflated power from buildings/research — easy target.</p>

            <h3>Hospital Strategy</h3>
            <p>Hospital capacity determines how many wounded troops you save.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Saturday bonus:</strong> Hospital capacity <strong>doubles</strong> during Enemy Buster and State Ruler</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> 7,000 capacity → 14,000 on Saturday</li>
                <li><strong>Each hospital level 25:</strong> +1,000 capacity bonus</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Research:</strong> Hospital Expansion (capacity) and Healing Speed in Rapid Growth tree.</p>

            <h3>Hero Selection for PvP</h3>
            <p>Pick heroes by their 3rd skill — first and second skills are similar across heroes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Good 3rd skills:</strong> Troop attack/defense, HP, damage resistance</li>
                <li><strong>Bad 3rd skills:</strong> Free radar events, resource production, training speed only</li>
                <li><strong>Season priority:</strong> S3 > S2 > S1 (newer heroes have better combat skills)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Canyon Clash — Alliance PvP</h2>

            <h3>Why Canyon Clash is the Best Event</h3>
            <p>Players agree: <strong>"PVP Events are why we play."</strong> Canyon Clash brings alliances together with strategy discussions and coordinated attacks. It's fun for everyone — not just whales.</p>

            <h3>Winning Tactics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use voice comms</strong> — Discord coordination beats individual strength</li>
                <li><strong>Guerilla tactics</strong> — hit-and-run, target isolated enemies</li>
                <li><strong>Focus fire</strong> — concentrate attacks on one target at a time</li>
                <li><strong>Timing</strong> — coordinate simultaneous strikes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When Outmatched</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Guerilla tactics still work</li>
                <li>Target resource nodes, not direct fights</li>
                <li>Make them work for every point</li>
                <li>Learn from losses — watch replays</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>SVS (State vs State)</h2>

            <h3>How SVS Works</h3>
            <p>SVS brings different servers together every two weeks for large-scale battles. <strong>Teamwork matters more than individual strength.</strong></p>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coordinate with all alliances in your state</li>
                <li>Assign roles: attackers, defenders, scouts</li>
                <li>Set rally points and timing</li>
                <li>Save resources for SVS week</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Capital Clash</h3>
            <p>Part of SVS — unlock all 9 boxes for maximum rewards. Requires state-wide coordination and planning.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>State Ruler</h2>

            <h3>The Kraken Problem</h3>
            <p><strong>Honest assessment:</strong> Many State Ruler matches boil down to 1-2 players so absurdly strong that no tactics can overcome the power gap.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some matches are complete massacres</li>
                <li>Weaker states sometimes don't engage at all</li>
                <li>Result: disappointment on both sides</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Focus on event points</strong> — not just wins</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid direct kraken fights</strong> — target other objectives</li>
                <li><strong>Coordinate with state</strong> — collective effort matters</li>
                <li><strong>Accept limitations</strong> — some fights aren't worth taking</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Zombie Siege and Tyrant kills don't count for State Ruler attacker rights.</p>

            <h2>Chip System Planning</h2>
            <p>Chips unlock around end of Season 2. Plan ahead:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Each formation needs <strong>separate chips</strong></li>
                <li>Chips used in Formation 1 cannot be used in Formation 2</li>
                <li>Orange quality chips provide resonance bonuses</li>
                <li>Components unlock at modification level 150</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Critical:</strong> Decide your main faction BEFORE chips arrive. Switching factions after investing in chips is extremely expensive.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <details>
                <summary>Should I focus on Blood Rose or Wings of Dawn?</summary>
                <p>Wings of Dawn. Most players use Blood Rose because it's released first, so Wings of Dawn gives you a counter advantage against the majority of opponents.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How do I know if someone is weak despite high power?</summary>
                <p>Check their kill count. High power but low kills means inflated power from buildings/research without actual combat strength.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>When should I attack during the week?</summary>
                <p>Saturday is best — hospital capacity doubles during Enemy Buster/State Ruler events, meaning fewer permanent troop losses.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What is Canyon Clash?</summary>
                <p>Alliance PvP event rewarding coordination over power. Use Discord voice comms and guerilla tactics. Even smaller alliances beat stronger ones with teamwork.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What is SVS?</summary>
                <p>Large-scale server vs server battles every 2 weeks. Teamwork matters most. Coordinate with all alliances in your state.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Why can't I beat krakens in State Ruler?</summary>
                <p>Power gaps are real. Some players spend $15k+ and can't be overcome with tactics. Focus on event points and objectives you can achieve.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Can I switch factions after investing in chips?</summary>
                <p>Technically yes, but extremely expensive. Each formation needs separate chips. Decide your faction before chip system arrives.</p>
