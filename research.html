        <section class="quick-answer">
            <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
            <p><strong>Optimal research order in Last Z:</strong> 1) Hero Training → stop at Cockpit, 2) Military Strategies → Troop HP buffs, 3) Peace Shield → Urgent Rescue (-20% losses), 4) Siege to Seize (optional), 5) UST for T10 units (long-term). Don't max Hero Training — badges are better spent elsewhere. Buy the second laboratory ASAP.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Research Priority Order</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Hero Training → Cockpit Only</h3>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> Cockpit gives meaningful hero stat boosts. After Cockpit, you only get ~400 extra ATK/DEF for extremely high badge costs.</p>
                <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Many players max Hero Training thinking it's important. It's a badge trap. Stop at Cockpit and move on.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Military Strategies → Troop HP</h3>
                <p><strong>Why:</strong> This tree is cheap and provides crucial Troop HP buffs. Focus on the bottom nodes that match your main faction's troop type (Assaulter for Blood Rose, etc.).</p>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don't max "Move Out" — it's expensive. Upgrade to level 10-20 max.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Peace Shield → Urgent Rescue</h3>
                <p><strong>Unlock requirements:</strong> 50% Shelter Building + 45% Military Strategies.</p>
                <p><strong>Key research:</strong> Urgent Rescue reduces unit deaths by up to 20% (10 ranks). This is the direct counter to enemy Annihilation skill. Essential for <a href="pvp.html">PvP</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Siege to Seize (Situational)</h3>
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This tree increases your Destruction Value. Only research if you're ready for more aggressive gameplay.</p>
                <p><strong>When to skip:</strong> If you prefer defensive play or are in a NAP alliance, delay this tree.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: UST (Special Unit Training)</h3>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Unlock T10 units — the strongest troops in the game.</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ~1.4 million badges total. Takes years for F2P or ~$15,000 to speed up. Farm badges from <a href="lucky-discounter.html">Lucky Discounter</a> events.</p>
                <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Start UST immediately after Urgent Rescue if you're committed to long-term progression.</p>

                <li><strong>Buy Second Laboratory</strong> — doubles your research speed, essential purchase</li>
                <li><strong>Align with Capital Buff</strong> — reduces research time by 1 hour when active</li>
                <li><strong>Save stars and speed-ups</strong> — use during research events for bonus rewards (see <a href="alliance-duel.html">Alliance Duel</a> Day 3)</li>
                <li><strong>Don't rush Fully Armed Alliance (FAA)</strong> — leave it for later, focus on defensive research first</li>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What research should I prioritize in Last Z?</h3>
                <p>Priority order: Hero Training to Cockpit → Military Strategies → Peace Shield (Urgent Rescue) → Siege to Seize → UST. This maximizes combat power while efficiently using badges.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is Hero Training worth maxing in Last Z?</h3>
                <p>No. Only research until Cockpit. After that, you get minimal stats (+400 ATK/DEF) for very high badge costs. Those badges are better spent on Military Strategies or saving for UST.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is Urgent Rescue in Last Z?</h3>
                <p>Urgent Rescue is a Peace Shield research that reduces unit deaths by up to 20%. It directly counters the enemy's Annihilation skill. Must-have for PvP content.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How many badges do I need for T10 units?</h3>
                <p>Approximately 1.4 million badges for full T10 unlock through UST. This takes years for F2P players. Whales can speed it up for around $15,000 USD.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I buy the second laboratory?</h3>
                <p>Yes, 100%. It doubles your research speed. One of the best investments in the game. Buy it as soon as you can afford it.</p>
            </div>
