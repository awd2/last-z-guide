            <h2>Fastest Leveling Strategies</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Strategy 1: Never Miss Daily Tasks</h3>
                <p>Daily tasks are your bread and butter. They provide consistent XP, resources, and premium currency. Complete all of them every single day — the rewards compound over time and the XP adds up significantly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Strategy 2: Push Main Campaign</h3>
                <p>The main campaign gives massive XP rewards for completing chapters. It also unlocks new features, buildings, and game modes. Don't get stuck farming early stages — push as far as you can.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Strategy 3: Command Center Priority</h3>
                <p>Your Command Center level caps everything else. Always have it upgrading. Use speed-ups on long Command Center upgrades to unlock new buildings and raise your power ceiling faster.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Strategy 4: Event Participation</h3>
                <p>Events offer 2-3x normal rewards plus exclusive items. Check events daily and complete as many milestones as possible. Even partial participation beats skipping entirely.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Strategy 5: Alliance Benefits</h3>
                <p>Active alliances provide: help with building/research timers, alliance gifts, group event rewards, and resource assistance. A good alliance can cut your progression time by 30-40%.</p>
