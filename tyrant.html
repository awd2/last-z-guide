            <h2>Why Tyrant Matters</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Main Source of Steel</h3>
                <p>Tyrant is the primary way to farm <strong>Steel</strong> in Last Z. Steel is required for HQ upgrades from level 31 to 35. The more damage your alliance deals, the better rewards everyone receives. See our <a href="hq.html">HQ Upgrade Guide</a> for Steel requirements and the <a href="steel.html">Steel Guide</a> for all sources.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Alliance-Wide Rewards</h3>
                <p>Tyrant rewards scale with total alliance performance. When your alliance deals more damage together, everyone gets better rewards — even lower-power players benefit from strong alliance coordination.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-content">
            <h2>Rally Strategy</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Recall Troops (5 Minutes Before)</h3>
                <p>Five minutes before Tyrant starts, <strong>recall all troops</strong> to your HQ. You need them ready for rallies immediately when the event begins. Don't leave troops gathering or marching.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 2: Only Join 7-8 Member Rallies</h3>
                <p>This is the most important rule. <strong>Never start or join a rally with less than 7 members.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>7-8 member rallies deal significantly more damage</li>
                    <li>Everyone in a full rally earns more points</li>
                    <li>Fewer members = wasted potential damage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you see a rally with only 3-4 members, wait for more to join or find another rally.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Fill Existing Rallies First</h3>
                <p><strong>Always check for open rallies before creating your own.</strong> If you see a 7-8 member rally that isn't full, join it. Only start a new rally when there are no open rallies to join.</p>
                <p>Why? The Tyrant event has a limited time window. By filling rallies quickly, your alliance can complete more rallies total, dealing more damage and earning more rewards.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Prioritize Nearby Members</h3>
                <p>When choosing which rally to join, <strong>focus on rallies from members who are close to the Tyrant</strong>. Shorter march time means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The attack starts faster</li>
                    <li>More rallies complete in the event window</li>
                    <li>Higher total alliance damage</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 5: Enable "Engage Offline"</h3>
                <p>Can't join at the scheduled time? No problem. Go to <strong>Event Center → Tyrant</strong> and tick <strong>"Engage offline"</strong>. Your troops will automatically join rallies while you're away.</p>
                <p>This ensures you still earn points and rewards even when you can't actively play. Always enable this as a backup.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li><strong>Coordinate with alliance chat</strong> — call out when you're starting a rally so others can join quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Use your strongest heroes</strong> — Tyrant damage counts, bring your best <a href="heroes.html">heroes</a> and formation</li>
                <li><strong>Check rally timer</strong> — join rallies with enough time left for your troops to arrive</li>
                <li><strong>Don't go solo</strong> — solo attacks deal minimal damage compared to full rallies</li>
                <li><strong>Set a reminder</strong> — Tyrant happens at fixed times, don't miss it</li>
                <li><strong>Use attack buffs</strong> — activate any attack bonuses before the event starts</li>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Starting Small Rallies</h3>
                <p>Never start a rally and immediately launch it with only 2-3 members. Wait until you have 7-8 members or let others fill it. Small rallies waste everyone's troops and time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Creating Duplicate Rallies</h3>
                <p>If there's already an open rally with space, join it instead of creating a new one. Multiple half-empty rallies are worse than fewer full rallies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Forgetting to Recall Troops</h3>
                <p>If your troops are gathering or marching when Tyrant starts, you'll miss the first rallies. Always recall 5 minutes before.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>Skipping the Event</h3>
                <p>Tyrant is too valuable to skip. Even if you can't join live, enable "Engage offline" to participate automatically. Steel is essential for late-game progression.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the best Tyrant rally size?</h3>
                <p>Always aim for 7-8 member rallies. They deal significantly more damage and give more points to all participants. Never start or join rallies with fewer than 7 members.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I get Steel from Tyrant?</h3>
                <p>Participate in every Tyrant event with full power. Enable "Engage offline" if you can't join live. Steel rewards scale with your alliance's total damage — stronger coordination means more Steel for everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is "Engage Offline"?</h3>
                <p>It's a setting in Event Center → Tyrant that automatically adds your troops to rallies when you're offline. Enable it to earn rewards even when you can't actively participate. Essential for busy players.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I create my own rally or join others?</h3>
                <p>Always fill existing 7-8 member rallies first. Only create your own when there are no open rallies to join. This maximizes the number of completed rallies during the event window.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When should I recall troops for Tyrant?</h3>
                <p>Recall all troops to your HQ about 5 minutes before the event starts. This ensures they're ready to join rallies immediately when Tyrant begins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When is Tyrant?</h3>
                <p>Tyrant happens 2–3 times per week depending on your server. The exact time is set in Event Center (Apocalypse Time).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What time is Tyrant?</h3>
                <p>R4/R5 can schedule the start time. Always check Event Center → Tyrant for the exact slot in Apocalypse Time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why are my Tyrant rewards low?</h3>
                <p>Low rewards mean: joining small rallies (less than 7 members), not participating in enough rallies, or your alliance dealing low total damage. Follow the 7-8 member rally strategy and coordinate with your alliance for better results.</p>
