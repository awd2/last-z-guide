  - **Text:** Ok, I worked on an analysis of these states ahead of the migration because it was asked on a different post These are analysis based on the power of the TOP 10 alliances on each state and the number of SvS wins which means there are many things that could have happened that might not represent the reality. keep in mind the info was gathered on a Thursday and many players wait until Friday to get back to full power! The most powerful server in terms of raw power is #259, but they failed to win a single SVS. The most successful servers #244 and #256 with 5 wins each, but #256 is one of the worst in terms of power (ranked 14 out of 19) which seems to be a great indication of teamwork. (They also have the most powerful player of the region which might be an indicator that SVS is heavily influenced by whales). The State with the most farms in top 10 is #246 which is also the state with less power. The top 3 whales are in #256 (532m power), #258 (503m power) and #241 (466m power). The states #243, #247 and #250 have the lowest power top players with 262~264 m power The best Alliances in term of raw power are in servers #245 (17.35 B power), #258 (17.29 B power) and #244 (#17.033 B power) The best states in term of power distribution (meaning that the power is less concentrated on fewer Alliances) are #259, #258 and #245 (in that order). Those states are more likely to get attacking rights on SvS since they have more alliances capable to win AvA. This is the screenshot of the data: https://i.imgur.com/U0EiKOl.png Hope this helps anyone thinking of migration to make an educated decision Safe options are #244, #241, #254 and #258 I would suggest caution for #256, it might be the best option if their low power is coming from low population, this would mean that they are work well together and it explains the high win count on SvS. Or it might be a different scenario altogether. I'm on #246 and we are suffering heavily by low population and it shows clearly on the data but the state cooperation is very good. I can't speak for the rest. cheers! =)

  - **Text:** 🔹 #65 became known for its undefeated record in SvS. It may not have the strongest whales in the game, but it is widely recognized as the most united server when it comes to cross-server wars. 🔹 #66 is led by the tyrant IRT, considered by many to have the strongest offensive power in SvS. An extremely aggressive server that sets the pace and pressure from the very beginning of battles. 🔹 #67, even after significant losses during the first migration, managed to reorganize and remain strong and competitive within the zone. 🔹 #74 is the main rival of #66. Many consider it to have the best defense in the bracket — to the point that the game developers had to adjust rules related to seasonal constructions. 🔹 #75 had the potential to be the strongest server in the war zone, but the civil war between Love & Shugg vs Vegas weakened its internal structure. 🔹 #78, led by the “Warlord” Chaddington (Teddy), is known for refined strategy. It delivered a memorable battle against #65. However, the server has been losing key players. 🔹 #87 may currently be the most dominant server in the zone. With LogoGR and Hamedo leading, they have been overpowering opponents consistently. Some even say they could challenge the golden server #15 of Kanasai. 🔹 #95 remains the most mysterious server in the bracket, but possibly the one with the greatest chance of defeating #87 in a direct SvS clash.
